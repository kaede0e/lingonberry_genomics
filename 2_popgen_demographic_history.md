## Population genetics and demographic history of lingonberry subspecies 
Questions to address:
* How do the two subspecies genomes differ? Are they different enough to be considered subspecies? (ssp. minus vs vitis-idaea) 
* How much are their genomes differentiated? 
* When did the two subspecies split? what are their common ancestors? 
* What is their demograhpic history? How did their populations evolve/change over time?

### population models ### 
Use multiple phased genome sequence simultaneously, by separating into maternal and paternal haplotypes ([MSMC](http://www.github.com/stschiff/msmc-tools)) \
This computes the most probable ancestral recombination histories based on genealogical trees. \
It approximates coalescence rates using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
